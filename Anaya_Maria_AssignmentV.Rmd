## 1. Setting up a new GitHub repository

A GitHub repository has been set up under the following link: https://github.com/maria-anaya/AssignmentV.git.


## 2. Getting to know the API

We can get the information of the following tables thanks to API: products, offers, events, attractions, areas, passwords, images, segments, venues, price-zones, prices, genres and sub-genres.
Filters can be applied. 

The rate limit is of 5000 calls of API per day and 5 requests per second.

In order to keep the key API secret, it is saved within another script


```{r 2API}
rm(list = ls())

# API key stored in another source
source('~/AssignmentV/script key.R')

```
